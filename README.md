# Employee Retention Intelligence System

## The Business Challenge
Employee turnover is an invisible tax on revenue. Recruitment costs, lost productivity, and knowledge drain cost companies billions annually. The core problem isn't just that people leave—it's that **it isn't seen until it's too late.**
The goal was to identify the "silent signals" of attrition — the combination of factors (commute, age, role, salary) that statistically predict a resignation.

## The Solution: A "What-If" Intelligence Engine
An interactive dashboard that serves as a risk-assessment calculator for HR managers.
* **Input:** Manager configures an employee profile (e.g., "Sales Executive, 30 years old, travels frequently").
* **Process:** The system runs this profile through a **Random Forest Classifier** trained on thousands of historic data points.
* **Output:** A real-time probability score (e.g., "64% Risk of Attrition"), allowing managers to intervene *before* the resignation letter lands.
